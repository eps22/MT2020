This is an info file about the medicanes tracking algorithm developed in the MAR group of the University of Murcia in 2019. Authors: Enrique Pravia-Sarabia, Juan Pedro Montávez-Gómez and Juan José Gómez-Navarro.


####
PART I: TRACKING ALGORITHM.
To run the tracking algorithm, you should go to the 'Code' folder and type the following command in the console:

bash findmedicanes.sh PATHTOWRFOUTPUTNCFILE RESOLUTION TIMESTEP NCORES 

PATHTOWRFOUTPUTNCFILE represents the path to a WRF output nc file which contains all the fields, timesteps and vertical levels. Resolution refers to the horizontal grid resolution -in km-, and timestep to the temporal resolution -in hours-. Path to file is to be introduced with no quotation marks. Either resolution or timestep, which should both be numbers. NCORES is the number of cores to be used in the parallelized calculation of the medicanes track. It is an optional arguments that defaults to the machine total number of cores if argument is not passed, saving one core to prevent overloading. 

Algorithm parameters can be changed in the FindMedicanes.namelist file inside the TrackingAlgorithm folder. This file must be in this exact location when running the findmedicanes bash script. The FindMedicanes.namelist.README file contains detailed information about the meaning of each parameter, its possible values and its recommended/default value.

PART II: TRACK POSTPROCESSING.

There are two postprocessing tools provided in this package, one for producing a plot with the track, and one for obtaining further data on the track parameters.

#Plot of calculated track
To plot the calculated track -SEE PART I-, you should go to the 'Code' folder and introduce the following command in the console:

bash plotmedicanestrack.sh PATHTOFOLDER ADJUST COMPLETE CONNECT SLPEXPANDN RESOLUTION DTHRESHOLD DTTHRESHOLD

PATHTOFOLDER must be the path to the folder created by the PART I. Inside that folder, it should be present the *-track.RData file -output of findmedicanes.sh-, along with a folder called 'output' containing the vertically interpolated files -slp, uvmet10 and z- in netcdf format. PATHTOFOLDER is to be introduced with no quotation marks. ADJUST should be one of TRUE/FALSE, and determines if the output map extent should be adjusted to the track, or the complete domain should be plotted instead. COMPLETE should be one of TRUE/FALSE, and determines if the track should be complemented with the SLP minimum path. CONNECT refers to the possibility of connecting track points trough a continuous line. SLPEXPANDN, RESOLUTION, DTHRESHOLD or DTTHRESHOLD should also be introduced as numbers. SLPEXPANDN is the number of track points that should be taken to expand the track at its beginning and ending. RESOLUTION represents the grid horizontal resolution in kilometers -the same as in the part I-; DTHRESHOLD refers to the maximum allowed distance between two track points to be connected -in km-, and a value of DTHRESHOLD below 200 km is highly recommended for physical reasons if timestep is 1 hour, 200km*timestep for other timestep values; DTTHRESHOLD is the maximum allowed time interval -in timesteps- between two points to be connected. A value of 1 or 2 is recommended for this last parameter. For example, with a value of 1 only consecutive points in time are connected. RESOLUTION, DTHRESHOLD and DTTHRESHOLD are optional arguments. If not provided, the plot won't have connected track dots, and only sparse points will be shown.   

Output of this tool is a pdf called trackplot.pdf, located inside the provided folder. 

#Obtain further data along calculated track

Go to the 'Code' folder and type in the console the following command:

bash getmedicanestrackdata.sh PATHTOFOLDER TYPE

PATHTOFOLDER should be the path to the folder created in the PART I. Inside that folder, it should be present the *-track.RData file -output of findmedicanes.sh-, along with a folder called 'output' containing the vertically interpolated files -slp, uvmet10 and z- in netcdf format. PATHTOFOLDER is to be introduced with no quotation marks. TYPE should be 'reduced' or 'complete' -the quotation marks are allowed but not needed'. 

Output of this tool is a csv called trackingdf.csv, located inside the provided folder.

The 'reduced' TYPE value gives the following track parametersS:

Date:                              date and time in the format YY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
